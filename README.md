## The Cat Dimension (Maze game)
It's a maze game and was developed during the first half of the semester while we learnt the basics of java and the coding best practices.

It consists of a two level game, the first level you have to get the lever without getting caught by the guard, and then proceding to the open doors.

The second level, the keep level, is a little more tricky, first instead of guards you have ogres with can atack in a random direction, you can also catch the red band to become a super cat with possibility to stun the ogres, you need to get to the key to unlock the doors and win the game.

You can also load  a savegame or even change the settings like how the guard behaves on the initial level, and the quantity of ogres.

Additionally you can create your own keep level, using the map creator.
